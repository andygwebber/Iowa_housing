The project results can be duplicated by running iowa_housing.ipynb. The first
10 blocks will import libraries and define functions. All libraries are available
in standard python 2.7 and do not need any special installation. 
Running the 11th block will select features. Running the 12th block will 
produce the validation curve. Running the 13th block will produce the 
learning curve and the final block will produce a file called “iowa_housing.csv” 
that can then be submitted to Kaggle. When the curves are produced, two 
output files called “valid.png” and “learning.png” are also produced that 
are images contaiing the validation plot and learning plot. 
The file imports two files called “train_NAL.csv” and “test_NAL.csv” that 
are described in the report.
